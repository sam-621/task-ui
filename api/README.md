# TASK API

API for the task management

## Installation

- install all dependencies

```
yarn
```

- Build and execute

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

- Create a file named .env.local for environment variables

```
touch .env.local
cp .env.example .env.local

```

To be sure that the project was executed correctly, in the console is going to appear a log that says "listening" and "DB connected". this last one can take time since it is the one that notifies the db is connected
